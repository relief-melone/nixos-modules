# Nixos Modules

My outsourced NixOS moduleso be used in various NixOS configurations

# Home-Manager
Home Manager modules like bash kitty or nixvim

# Machines
Machine specific configurations. Currently only my thin clients

# Network
Network specific modules. Like including self signed vcertificats and such

# Nixpkgs-additions
Additions I made to nixpkgs. Some might get a PR to be included in nixpkgs (and will be taken out here after the merge) and some won't.
